# what I felt after this 1wwek of project

## I tend to just start it.

But after do this project, I felt more like, "I should prefer to make class abtract specifications".

There's a lot of code that better do refactoring, but too much code is kinda "spaghetti".
It seems more harder that to do refactor these codes after "just do it"

## I should search more about knowledges.
